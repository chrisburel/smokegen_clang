# smokegen_clang
A version of the smokegen tool built on top of clang.  The goal of this project is to parse the Qt headers with clang, instead of a builtin c++ parser like the existing smokegen tool implements.

This tool is in a highly experimental state.  It currently cannot generate the same output that the real smokegen does.

See https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/kdebindings/smoke/smokegen for the production version.
